"""Unique Paths II

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/

You are given an `m Ã— n` integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
