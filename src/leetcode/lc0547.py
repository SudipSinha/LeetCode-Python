"""Number of Provinces

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/

There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n Ã— n` matrix isConnected where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `i`th city and the `j`th city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.
